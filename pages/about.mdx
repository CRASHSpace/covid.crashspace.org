## Fundraising

We are running a gofundme campaign to cover material costs for all manufactured PPE donated to hospitals. They campaign is being organized by Crashspace, a 501(c)(3) exempt charity. Any surplus we cannot reasonably use will be donated to other COVID-19 relief efforts or relevant 501(c)(3) exempt charities not part of this campaign. Thank you for your financial support.
