# Open-Fold Face-Shield (OFFS) Project

## Fold-a-Shield designs for rapid assembly, flat-cut Face-Shields

These designs can be used to make complete PPE ‘Face-shields’† using only thin plastic materials and some folding. NO NEED FOR ANY OTHER MATERIALS OR ASSEMBLY. We have developed a range of designs that we believe will work for different materials and cutting methods, depending on what you have available.
